Usage:
Replace your exponent with the corresponding prefix. For example:
2.18e-18 --> 2.18*E

Doesn't really save space, but it's nice to have them here so you don't have to look 'em up.

"""
The energy level of a given electron shell (in Bohr's atomic model) for a hydrogen atom

"""
Calculates energy needed to exitate or deexitate the current electron shell,
where n1 is the starting shell, and n2 is the ending shell.

"""
Uses time to divide waves by time and get the frequency of a wave.
"""
def freqOld(T, S=1): return S/T

"""
Calculates wave speed by multiplying wavelength(λ) by frequency(f)
"""
def speed(λ, f): return λ*f

"""
Calculates Frequency by dividing speed of the wave(c or other if that is specified) by wavelength(λ)
"""
def freq(λ, v=c): return v/λ

"""
Calculates wavelength(λ) by dividing the velocity of the wave(v, implicitly c) by frequency(f)
"""
def wl(f, v=c): return v/f

"""
Calculates Energy of a given photon with frequency f. 
Takes Plancks-constant(h) and frequency(f)
