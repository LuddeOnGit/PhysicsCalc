# SI prefixes
"""
Usage:
Replace your exponent with the corresponding prefix. For example:
2.18e-18 --> 2.18*E

Doesn't really save space, but it's nice to have them here so you don't have to look 'em up.

# Physical constants.
"""
c : The speed of light in a vacuum. In m/s
cv: The speed of light in water. In m/s
h : Planck constant. In Js
B : Bohr's constant. In J
u = atomic mass unit (mass at atomic levels)
"""
c,cv,h,B, u = 3e8, 0.751*3e8, 6.63e-34, 2.18e-18, 1.66e-27

"""
The energy level of a given electron shell (in Bohr's atomic model) for a hydrogen atom
"""
def eHyd(shell): return - B / shell**2

"""
Calculates energy needed to exitate or deexitate the current electron shell,
where n1 is the starting shell, and n2 is the ending shell.
"""
def eHydDiff(n1,n2): return eHyd(n1)-eHyd(n2)


"""
Calculates wave speed by multiplying wavelength(λ) by frequency(f)
"""
def speed(λ, f): return λ*f

"""
Calculates Frequency by dividing speed of the wave(c or other if that is specified) by wavelength(λ)
"""
def freq(λ, v=c): return v/λ

"""
Calculates wavelength(λ) by dividing the velocity of the wave(v, implicitly c) by frequency(f)
"""
def wl(f, v=c): return v/f

"""
Calculates Energy of a given photon with frequency f. 
Takes Plancks-constant(h) and frequency(f)
"""
def ef(f): return h*f

"""
Plugs c=λf into E=hf to get E=hc/λ
"""
def el(λ): return (h*c)/λ

"""
Gives energy amount by using Einstein's formula given mass and lightspeed squared
"""
def mass(m, v=c): return m*(v**2)

"""
converts u to kg, m = mass in u
"""
def massConvU(m): return m*u

"""
Converts kg to kg, m = mass in kg
"""
def massConvKg(m): return m/u


"""
Returns in the form of a string the electon configuration of the various orbitals.
While technically lernt in chemistry, this is relevant in all the natural sciences.
Takes electron count (ec), and whether to shorten the result with the last noble gas (short)
