# PhysicsCalc
A program developed by students at NRG to make Physics and Chemistry easier.

A website is under development to further ease the use for non-programmers. The main programs can be found in Python4Physics.py and Python4Chemistry.py. A periodic table can be found in the PeriodicTable.py.

This is a program which is under constant development. It gets developed as we progress in the subjects.

If you want to run the website navigate to the website folder in the command prompt, then type run and hit enter.
Note: If you change any code within the website folder go back to the command prompt, press control + c so that the web server shuts down and then type run and hit enter again to run the new code.
