# PhysicsCalc
A program developed by students at NRG to make Physics and Chemistry easier.

A website is under development to further ease the use for non-programmers. The main programs can be found in Python4Physics.py and Python4Chemistry.py. A periodic table can be found in the PeriodicTable.py.

This is a program which is under constant development. It gets developed as we progress in the subjects.
