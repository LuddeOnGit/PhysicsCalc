Prokaryote:
    
    Bacteria:
        Circulatory system:
            Bacteria use diffusion to exchange nutrition with its surroundings.
            It is able to do this due to the bacteria being one cell only.

        Respiratory system:
            Gas is exchanged right through the cell with diffusion.
        
        Waste production:
            Bacteria use diffusion to get rid of waste such as pure ammonia and carbondioxide.

        Reproduction:
            Mitosis is the common way for a bacteria to reproduce.
            This involves the bacteria's DNA copying itself and divide into two equal cells with the same DNA.


    Archea:
        Circulatory system:
            Archea are quite similar to bacteria as they also use diffusion to exchange nutrition with its surroundings.
            This is due to it being a single cell.
        
        Respiratory system:

Eukaryote:

    Mammals:
        Circulatory system:
            Most mammals have a double circulatory system. One part of the system sends blood to the respiratory system and another part sends blood to the rest of the body.
        Respiratory system:

    Bald eagle:
        Circulatory system:
            Four chambered heart with arteries and veins transporting blood. Eagles also have a closed circulatory system.
        Respiratory system:
            Two air sacks that drag in and push out air and one lung with doesnt move where the gas exchange happens. It has one breathing hole on each side of it's mouth. Air passes through the lungs twice per breath cycle.
        Waste system: 
            Birds make uric acid in their body and the get rid of it through a mix of urine and poop called mute.
        Reproduction:
            One male and one female make children together. The baby grows up in an egg until it cracks out. 

    Fish:
        Circulatory system:
            Fish have a two chambered heart with one atrium and ventricle. Fish also have a closed circulatory system.Fish have one circulatory system where blood is pumped to the gills and then to the rest of the body without going back through the heart. This takes less energy from the fish, but the blood pressure is also lower so it's less effective. This system works for fish but wouldn't work for humans.
        Respiratory system:
            Fish use gills for gas exchange. They have blood veins in the gills so that the blood flows against the current. This makes for a very effective absorption of oxygen and removal of carbondioxid.
        Waste system:Â¨
            The primary excretory organ of fish is the kidney but they also use their gills for removing ammonia and some other substances. The kidney, skin and gills work together to keep the salt balance stable within the fish.
        Reproduction:
            Most fish reproduce with one male and one female. The female produces eggs and drops them into the water. The male then puts his sperm onto the eggs. Some fish can also switch their genders to produce both eggs and sperm.
